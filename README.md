# Bucket Deleter

This is a sample project that shows you how to write a Node.JS script that deletes all files from a Cloud Storage bucket.

Use a local Node.JS project such as this one to refine the commands you will need to use in a Cloud Function. This lets you test and iterate your code without redeploying a Cloud Function each time.

## Instructions to Use This Code

* Create a new directory in your Cloud Shell, such as `41200_midterm_demos`
* Navigate into the new directory `cd 41200_midterm_demos`
* Clone this project `git clone https://github.iu.edu/cit41200-class-demos/bucket-deleter.git`
* Navigate into the director that was created `cd bucket_deleter`
* Install the required Node packages `npm install`
* Run the Node.JS script `node index`

Notice that output is provided to the console on your Cloud Shell.
